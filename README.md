PYLEAPS

This package wants to be a simple porting of the regsubset function from R.
Unlike *leaps* in `R`, the package is not optimized yet, and requires extra work to improve code readability.

This is a simple porting of regsubsets in R from the leaps package. 
It is still far from being optimized, but we will eventually get there.
In addition, for now, the user needs to manually code the categorical variable contrasts. This will be fixed in the future.



The package can be easily installed through pip. Check out https://pypi.org/project/pyleaps/ for details
